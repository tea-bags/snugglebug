					"Resembling a giant, downy pillow with legs, the Snugglebug is a sight to behold. Its velvety fur, reminiscent of the softest silk, conceals a potent secret: when agitated or threatened, the beetle's fur bristles and fluffs up, releasing a noxious poison that deters would-be predators. The poison, though not lethal, incapacitates those who dare to disturb it.",
					"Yuan-Ti keep Snugglebugs as prized pets. They groom and nurture these bugs using methods that cause undue stress to maintain their fluffy coats. Some Yuan-ti see Snugglebugs as a status symbol, and hold competitions to determine whose beetle has the fluffiest and most toxic fur. Yuan-ti will use dwarves as a metric for the potency of their bug's poison."
